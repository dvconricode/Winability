# Winability

Winability is a web application designed towards new investors who may be swayed speculation and hype around a certain stock. A user can search for a stock and the website will display the stock's price and win/loss percentage. We hope this can act as a tool to help investors not fall into investments beyond their risk tolerance.

To run the Django webpage: 

1. Download the repository
2. Navigate to the website-outer folder within HackDavis-2021 in your terminal
3. In your terminal enter `python3 manage.py runserver` 
4. Once you see "Quit the server with CTRL-BREAK" go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/displaytable/ in your browser

On the home page you will see a couple of our pre-selected stocks ordered by their current win rate. To explore the search feature try entering "AAPL" or "TSLA" and clicking "Search"




This project was built by Dominic Conricode, Richard Ge, Jasper Tsai, and Love Chien for HackDavis 2021 over a period of 36 hours.
